```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("setup.R")
```

Let's read in the dataset.

```{r}
crop_freq <- read_excel("CropsGrown.xlsx", 
    range = "A1:M13")
View(crop_freq)
```

As one can see, it isn't super workable at the moment. Let's use pivot_longer() to get it in a format we can use.

```{r}
crop_freq_tidy <- crop_freq %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:13, 
               names_to = "County", 
               values_to = "CropType") %>%
  na.omit() #drop all rows with NA's
```

```{r}
crop_freq_tidy %>%
  group_by(CropType) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = CropType, y = Count)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 13, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Agricultural Products Produced",
       subtitle = "CO Counties of Interest: Adams, Cheyenne, Elbert, Kit Carson, Larimer, Lincoln, Logan, \nMorgan, Phillips, Sedgwick, Washington, Weld, and Yuma",
       x = "Agricultural Product",
       y = "Number of Counties") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = "16"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = "10"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = "10"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = "5", angle = 22.5),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = "5")
  ) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 6, y = 12.5, 
           label = "Corn is produced by \nall 13 counties.",
           size = 2.75) +
  geom_curve(aes(x = 4.3, xend = 3, y = 12.5, yend = 10.5),
             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
             size = 0.5,
             curvature = 0.3)
  
# make sure to mention kelly, and the year
